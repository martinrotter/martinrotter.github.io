I was having some very weird errors when I was testing out [TT-RSS](https://tt-rss.org/wiki/ApiReference) API. One of the methods just would not work and server reported `HTTP/500` error. I figured out that the error is only there, if I use non-`ASCII` characters in my POST data.

My `curl` one-line to call the API was something like:

```bash
curl -H "Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8" -d '{"op":"shareToPublished","title":"ččč","url":"https://aaa.cz","content":"aaa","sid":"XXX"}' 'https://TT_RSS_SERVER/api/'
```

I was thinking that, OK, I have `charset=utf-8` in my `Content-Type` and that's it, `curl` should encode input data correctly, right? At least, that was what some clever people suggested on `StackOverflow`.

Well, then I decided to see what is actually sent with `--trace` option and that clearly showed, that `č` characters are encoded as `e8` (HEX) which is not what I would [expect](https://symbl.cc/en/010D/).

I subsequently checked my command line "encoding" with `locale` command and that was OK, I had `cs_CZ.UTF-8` there. It seems, that for some reason, `curl` was encoding my data as `windows-1250`, not `UTF-8`.

Therefore I tried to do the encoding stuff by myself with great `iconv` tool, resulting in this:

```bash
curl -H "Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8" --data "$(echo -n '{"op":"shareToPublished","title":"ččč","url":"https://aaa.cz","content":"aaa","sid":"XXX"}' | iconv -f windows-1250 -t utf-8)" 'https://TT_RSS_SERVER/api/'
```

And, this worked! So, at least I finally learned how to actually send real `UTF-8` POST requests.
